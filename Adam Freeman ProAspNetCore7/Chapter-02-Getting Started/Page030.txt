2.3.4 Putting the pieces together

It is a simple result, but this example reveals all the building blocks you need to create
a simple ASP.NET Core web application and to generate a dynamic response.
The ASP.NET Core platform receives an HTTP request and uses the routing system
to match the request URL to an endpoint. The endpoint, in this case, is the Index
action method defined by the Home controller. The method is invoked and produces
a ViewResult object that contains the name of a view and a view model object. The
Razor view engine locates and processes the view, evaluating the @Model expression
to insert the data provided by the action method into the response, which is returned
to the browser and displayed to the user. There are, of course, many other features
available, but this is the essence of ASP.NET Core, and it is worth bearing this simple
sequence in mind as you read the rest of the book.

Summary

•	ASP.NET Core development can be done with Visual Studio or Visual Studio
	Code, or you can choose your own code editor.

•	Most code editors provide integrated code builds, but the most reliable way to get
	consistent results across tools and platforms is by using the dotnet command.

•	ASP.NET Core relies on endpoints to process HTTP requests.

•	Endpoints can be written entirely in C# or use HTML that has been annotated
	with code expressions.
