2.2 Creating an ASP.NET Core project

The most direct way to create a project is to use the command line. Open a new Power-
Shell command prompt from the Windows Start menu, navigate to the folder where
you want to create your ASP.NET Core projects, and run the commands shown in listing 2.3.

TIP
You can download the example project for this chapter—and for all the
other chapters in this book—from https://github.com/manningbooks/pro-asp.net-core-7. 
See chapter 1 for how to get help if you have problems running the examples.

Listing 2.3 Creating a new project

dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 7.0.100 --output FirstProject
dotnet new mvc --no-https --output FirstProject --framework net7.0
dotnet new sln -o FirstProject
dotnet sln FirstProject add FirstProject

The first command creates a folder named FirstProject and adds to it a file named
global.json, which specifies the version of .NET that the project will use; this ensures
you get the expected results when following the examples. The second command creates
a new ASP.NET Core project. The .NET SDK includes a range of templates for
starting new projects, and the mvc template is one of the options available for ASP.NET
Core applications. This project template creates a project that is configured for the
MVC Framework, which is one of the application types supported by ASP.NET Core.
Don’t be intimidated by the idea of choosing a framework, and don’t worry if you have
not heard of MVC—by the end of the book, you will understand the features that each
offers and how they fit together. The remaining commands create a solution file, which
allows multiple projects to be used together.
