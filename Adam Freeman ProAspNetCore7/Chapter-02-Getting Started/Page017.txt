Installing the .NET SDK

The Visual Studio Code installer does not include the .NET SDK, which 
must be installed separately. Go to
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0 and download 
the installer for version 7.0.0 of the .NET SDK, which is the long-term 
support release at the time of writing. Run the installer; once the
installation is complete, open a new PowerShell command prompt from 
the Windows Start menu and run the command shown in Listing 2-2, 
which displays a list of the installed .NET SDKs.

Listing 2-2. Listing the Installed SDKs

dotnet --list-sdks

Here is the output from a fresh installation on a Windows machine that has not been
used for .NET:

7.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

If you have been working with different versions of .NET, you may see a longer list, like
this one:

5.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.113 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.202 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.203 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
7.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

Regardless of how many entries there are, you must ensure there is one for the 7.0.1xx
version, where the last two digits may differ.

Installing SQL Server LocalDB

The database examples in this book require LocalDB, which is a zero-configuration
version of SQL Server that can be installed as part of the SQL Server Express edition,
which is available for use without charge from 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads. 
Download and run the Express edition installer and
select the Custom option, as shown in figure 2-6.
