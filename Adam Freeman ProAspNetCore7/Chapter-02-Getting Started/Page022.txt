2.3 Running the ASP.NET Core application

Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code can both run projects directly, but I use the command
line tools throughout this book because they are more reliable and work more
consistently, helping to ensure you get the expected results from the examples.

When the project is created, a file named launchSettings.json is created in the
Properties folder, and it is this file that determines which HTTP port ASP.NET Core
will use to listen for HTTP requests. Open this file in your chosen editor and change the
ports in the URLs it contains to 5000, as shown in listing 2.4.

Listing 2.4 Setting the Port in the launchSettings.json File in the Properties Folder

{
	"iisSettings": {
		"windowsAuthentication": false,
		"anonymousAuthentication": true,
		"iisExpress": {
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
			"sslPort": 0
		}
	},
	"profiles": {
		"FirstProject": {
			"commandName": "Project",
			"dotnetRunMessages": true,
			"launchBrowser": true,
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
			"environmentVariables": {
				"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
		}
	},
	"IIS Express": {
		"commandName": "IISExpress",
		"launchBrowser": true,
		"environmentVariables": {
			"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
	}
	}
	}
}

It is only the URL in the profiles section that affects the .NET command-line tools,
but I have changed both of them to avoid any problems. Open a new PowerShell command
prompt from the Windows Start menu; navigate to the FirstProject project
folder, which is the folder that contains the FirstProject.csproj file; and run the
command shown in listing 2.5.

Listing 2.5 Starting the example application
dotnet run

The dotnet run command compiles and starts the project. Once the application has
started, open a new browser window and request http://localhost:5000, which will produce
the response shown in figure 2-14.

When you are finished, use Control+C to stop the ASP.NET Core application.
