2.2.2 Opening the project with Visual Studio Code

Start Visual Studio Code and select File > Open Folder. Navigate to the FirstProject
folder and click the Select Folder button. Visual Studio Code will open the project and
display its contents in the Explorer pane, as shown in figure 2-12. (The default dark
theme used in Visual Studio Code doesn’t show well on the page, so I have changed to
the light theme for the screenshots in this book.)

Additional configuration is required the first time you open a .NET project in Visual
Studio Code. The first step is to click the Program.cs file in the Explorer pane. This
will trigger a prompt from Visual Studio Code to install the features required for C#
development, as shown in figure 2.13. If you have not opened a C# project before, you
will see a prompt that offers to install the required assets, also shown in figure 2-13.

Click the Install or Yes button, as appropriate, and Visual Studio Code will download
and install the features required for .NET projects.
