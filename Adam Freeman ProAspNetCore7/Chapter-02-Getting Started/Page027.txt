Figure 2-17 Selecting a Visual Studio item template
(https://sergeyshef.ru/images/freeman-asp-net-core-7/Figure-2-17.webp)

Visual Studio Code doesn’t provide item templates. Instead, right-click the Views/
Home folder in the file explorer pane and select New File from the pop-up menu. Set
the name of the file to MyView.cshtml and press Return. The file will be created and
opened for editing. Add the content shown in listing 2.8.

TIP
It is easy to end up creating the view file in the wrong folder. If you didn’t
end up with a file called MyView.cshtml in the Views/Home folder, then either
drag the file into the correct folder or delete the file and try again.

Listing 2.8 The contents of the MyView.cshtml file in the Views/Home folder

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>Index</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div>
			Hello World (from the view)
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
The new contents of the view file are mostly HTML. The exception is the part that
looks like this:
...
@{
Layout = null;
}
...
