When the installer files have been downloaded, you will be presented 
with a set of installation options, grouped into workloads. Ensure that the 
“ASP.NET and web development” workload is checked, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Select the “Individual components” section at the top of the window and ensure 
the SQL Server Express 2019 LocalDB option is checked, as shown in Figure 2-4. 
This is the database component that I will be using to store data in later chapters.

Click the Install button, and the files required for the selected workload will 
be downloaded and installed. To complete the installation, a reboot may be required.

NOTE 
You must also install the SDK, as described in the following section.

Installing the .NET SDK

The Visual Studio installer will install the .NET Software Development Kit (SDK), 
but it may not install the version required for the examples in this book. 
Go to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0
and download the installer for version 7.0.0 of the .NET SDK, which is 
the long-term support release at the time of writing.
