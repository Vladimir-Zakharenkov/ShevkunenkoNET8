NOTE
This is one of a small number of chapters in which I use a project template
that contains placeholder content. I don’t like using predefined project
templates because they encourage developers to treat important features, such
as authentication, as black boxes. My goal in this book is to give you the knowledge
to understand and manage every aspect of your ASP.NET Core applications,
and that’s why I start with an empty ASP.NET Core project. This chapter is
about getting started quickly, for which the mvc template is well-suited.

2.2.1 Opening the project using Visual Studio

Start Visual Studio and click the “Open a project or solution” button, as shown in figure
2-10.

Navigate to the FirstProject folder, select the FirstProject.sln file, and click the
Open button. Visual Studio will open the project and display its contents in the Solution
Explorer window, as shown in figure 2-11. The files in the project were created by
the project template.
