Run the installer; once the installation is complete, open a new PowerShell 
command prompt from the Windows Start menu and run the command shown 
in Listing 2-1, which displays a list of the installed .NET SDKs.

Listing 2-1. Listing the Installed SDKs

dotnet --list-sdks

Here is the output from a fresh installation on a Windows machine that has not been
used for .NET:

7.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

If you have been working with different versions of .NET, you may see a longer list, like
this one:

5.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.113 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.202 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
6.0.203 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
7.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]

Regardless of how many entries there are, you must ensure there is one for the 7.0.1xx
version, where the last two digits may differ.

2.1.2 Installing Visual Studio Code

If you have chosen to use Visual Studio Code, download the installer from 
https://code.visualstudio.com. No specific version is required, and you should select the current
stable build. Run the installer and ensure you check the Add to PATH option, as
shown in figure 2-5.
