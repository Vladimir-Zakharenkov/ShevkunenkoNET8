The unit test creates an array of Product objects and checks that they correspond 
to the ones the Index action method provides as the view model. (Ignore the act 
section of the test for the moment; I explain the ViewResult class in Chapters 21 
and 22. For the moment, it is enough to know that I am getting the model
data returned by the Index action method.)
