Selecting the HTTP Port

Set the port on which ASP.NET Core will receive HTTP requests by editing 
the launchSettings.json file in the Properties folder, as shown 
in Listing 6-2.

Listing 6-2. Setting the HTTP Port in the launchSettings.json File 
in the Properties Folder

{
	"iisSettings": {
		"windowsAuthentication": false,
		"anonymousAuthentication": true,
		"iisExpress": {
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
			"sslPort": 0
			}
		},
		"profiles": {
			"SimpleApp": {
				"commandName": "Project",
				"dotnetRunMessages": true,
				"launchBrowser": true,
				"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
				"environmentVariables": {
					"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
			}
		},
		"IIS Express": {
			"commandName": "IISExpress",
			"launchBrowser": true,
			"environmentVariables": {
				"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
			}
		}
	}
}

Enabling the MVC Framework

As I explained in Chapter 1, ASP.NET Core supports different application 
frameworks, but I am going to continue using the MVC Framework in this chapter. 
I introduce the other frameworks in the SportsStore application that I start 
to build in Chapter 7, but for the moment, the MVC Framework gives me 
a foundation for demonstrating how to perform unit testing that is familiar 
from earlier examples. Add the statements shown in Listing 6-3 to 
the Program.cs file in the SimpleApp folder.
