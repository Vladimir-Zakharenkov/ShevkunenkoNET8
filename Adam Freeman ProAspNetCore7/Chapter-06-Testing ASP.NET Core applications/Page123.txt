The Product class defines Name and Price properties, and there is a static 
method called GetProducts that returns a Products array.

Creating the Controller and View

For the examples in this chapter, I use a simple controller class 
to demonstrate different language features. I created a Controllers 
folder and added to it a class file called HomeController.cs, 
the contents of which are shown in Listing 6-5.

Listing 6.5 The contents of the HomeController.cs file in the Controllers folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using SimpleApp.Models;

namespace SimpleApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            return View(Product.GetProducts());
        }
    }
}

The Index action method tells ASP.NET Core to render the default view 
and provides it with the Product objects obtained from the static 
Product.GetProducts method. To create the view for the action method, 
I added a Views/Home folder (by creating a Views folder and then adding 
a Home folder within it) and added a Razor View called Index.cshtml, 
with the contents shown in Listing 6.6

Listing 6.6 The contents of the Index.cshtml file in the Views/Home folder

@using SimpleApp.Models

@model IEnumerable<Product>

@{
    Layout = null;
}

        @foreach (Product p in Model ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>())
        {
            <li>Name: @p.Name, Price: @p.Price</li>
        }
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
