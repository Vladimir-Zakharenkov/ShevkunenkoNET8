CHAPTER 6

Testing ASP.NET Core applications

This chapter covers

•	Creating unit tests projects for ASP.NET Core application

•	Writing and running unit tests

•	Isolating application components for testing

•	Simplifying component isolation with a mocking package

In this chapter, I demonstrate how to unit test ASP.NET Core applications. 
Unit testing is a form of testing in which individual components are isolated 
from the rest of the application so their behavior can be thoroughly validated. 
ASP.NET Core has been designed to make it easy to create unit tests, and there 
is support for a wide range of unit testing frameworks. I show you how to set 
up a unit test project and describe the process for writing and running tests. 
Table 6.1 summarizes the chapter.
