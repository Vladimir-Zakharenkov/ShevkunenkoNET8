The test passes, but it isn’t a useful result because the Product data that 
I am testing is coming from the hardwired objects’ Product class. I can’t write 
a test to make sure that the controller behaves correctly when there are more 
than two Product objects, for example, or if the Price property of the first object 
has a decimal fraction. The overall effect is that I am testing the combined behavior 
of the HomeController and Product classes and only for the specific hardwired objects.

Unit tests are effective when they target small parts of an application, such as 
an individual method or class. What I need is the ability to isolate the Home controller 
from the rest of the application so that I can limit the scope of the test and rule out 
any impact caused by the repository.

Isolating a Component

The key to isolating components is to use C# interfaces. To separate the controller 
from the repository, I added a new class file called IDataSource.cs to the Models 
folder and used it to define the interface shown in Listing 6-15.

Listing 6-15. The Contents of the IDataSource.cs File in the SimpleApp/Models Folder

namespace SimpleApp.Models {
	public interface IDataSource {
		IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; }
	}
}

In Listing 6-16, I have removed the static method from the Product class and 
created a new class that implements the IDataSource interface.

Listing 6-16. Creating a Data Source in the Product.cs File 
in the SimpleApp/Models Folder

namespace SimpleApp.Models {
	public class Product {

		public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public decimal? Price { get; set; }

		//public static Product[] GetProducts() {
		// Product kayak = new Product {
		// Name = "Kayak", Price = 275M
		// };
		// Product lifejacket = new Product {
		// Name = "Lifejacket", Price = 48.95M
		// };
		// return new Product[] { kayak, lifejacket };
		//}
	}

	public class ProductDataSource : IDataSource {
		public IEnumerable<Product> Products =>
		new Product[] {
			new Product { Name = "Kayak", Price = 275M },
			new Product { Name = "Lifejacket", Price = 48.95M }
		};
	}
}
