Run the tests again, and you will see they all pass. If you are using 
Visual Studio, you can click the Run Failed Tests button, which will 
execute only the tests that failed, as shown in Figure 6.4

6.3.5		Isolating Components for Unit Testing

Writing unit tests for model classes like Product is easy. Not only is the Product 
class simple, but it is selfcontained, which means that when I perform an action 
on a Product object, I can be confident that I am testing the functionality provided 
by the Product class.

The situation is more complicated with other components in an ASP.NET Core application 
because there are dependencies between them. The next set of tests that I define 
will operate on the controller, examining the sequence of Product objects that are 
passed between the controller and the view.

When comparing objects instantiated from custom classes, you will need to use 
the xUnit.net Assert.Equal method that accepts an argument that implements 
the IEqualityComparer<T> interface so that the objects can be compared. My first 
step is to add a class file called Comparer.cs to the unit test project
and use it to define the helper classes shown in Listing 6-13.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace SimpleApp.Tests
{
    public class Comparer
    {
        public static Comparer<U?> Get<U>(Func<U?, U?, bool> func)
        {
            return new Comparer<U?>(func);
        }
    }

    public class Comparer<T> : Comparer, IEqualityComparer<T>
    {
        private Func<T?, T?, bool> comparisonFunction;

        public Comparer(Func<T?, T?, bool> func)
        {
            comparisonFunction = func;
        }

        public bool Equals(T? x, T? y)
        {
            return comparisonFunction(x, y);
        }

        public int GetHashCode(T obj)
        {
            return obj?.GetHashCode() ?? 0;
        }
    }
}
