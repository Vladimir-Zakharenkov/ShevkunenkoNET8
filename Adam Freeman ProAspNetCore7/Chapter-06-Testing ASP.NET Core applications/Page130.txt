Tip
Build the solution if you don’t see the unit tests in the Test Explorer window. 
Compilation triggers the process by which unit tests are discovered.

Run the tests by clicking the Run All Tests button in the Test Explorer window 
(it is the button that shows two arrows and is the first button in the row at 
the top of the window). As noted, the CanChangeProductPrice test contains 
an error that causes the test to fail, which is clearly indicated in the test results shown in
the figure.

Running Tests with Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code detects tests and allows them to be run using the code 
lens feature, which displays details about code features in the editor. 
To run all the tests in the ProductTests class, click Run All Tests in
the code editor when the unit test class is open, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Tip
Close and reopen the Testing folder in Visual Studio Code if you don’t see the code lens test features.
