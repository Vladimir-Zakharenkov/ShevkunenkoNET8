Run the tests by clicking the Run All Tests button in the Test Explorer window 
(it is the button that shows two arrows and is the first button in the row at 
the top of the window). As noted, the CanChangeProductPrice test contains 
an error that causes the test to fail, which is clearly indicated in the test results shown in
the figure.

6.3.2		Running Tests with Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code detects tests and allows them to be run using the code 
lens feature, which displays details about code features in the editor. 
To run all the tests in the ProductTests class, click Run All Tests in
the code editor when the unit test class is open, as shown in Figure 6.3

Tip
Close and reopen the Testing folder in Visual Studio Code if you don’t see the code lens test features.

Figure 6.3 Running tests with the Visual Studio Code code lens feature

Visual Studio Code runs the tests using the command-line tools that I describe in the
following section, and the results are displayed as text in a terminal window.

6.3.3 Running tests from the command line

To run the tests in the project, run the command shown in listing 6.11 in the Testing folder.

dotnet test

The tests are discovered and executed, producing the following results, which show
the deliberate error that I introduced earlier:

Starting test execution, please wait...
