Listing 6-3. Enabling the MVC Framework in the Program.cs File in the SimpleApp Folder

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

//app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

app.Run();

Creating the Application Components

Now that the MVC Framework is set up, I can add the application components 
that I will use to run tests.

Creating the Data Model

I started by creating a simple model class so that I can have some data 
to work with. I added a folder called Models and created a class file called 
Product.cs within it, which I used to define the class shown in
Listing 6-4.

Listing 6-4. The Contents of the Product.cs File in the SimpleApp/Models Folder

namespace SimpleApp.Models {
	public class Product {

		public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public decimal? Price { get; set; }

		public static Product[] GetProducts() {

			Product kayak = new Product {
				Name = "Kayak", Price = 275M
			};

			Product lifejacket = new Product {
				Name = "Lifejacket", Price = 48.95M
		};

		return new Product[] { kayak, lifejacket };

		}
	}
}

The Product class defines Name and Price properties, and there is a static 
method called GetProducts that returns a Products array.
