6.3.4		Correcting the Unit Test

The problem with the unit test is with the arguments to the Assert.Equal method, 
which compares the test result to the original Price property value rather than 
the value it has been changed to. Listing 6.12 corrects the problem.

Tip
When a test fails, it is always a good idea to check the accuracy of the test 
before looking at the component it targets, especially if the test is new or 
has been recently modified.

Listing 6.12 Correcting a test in the ProductTests.cs file in the SimpleApp.Tests folder

using SimpleApp.Models;
using Xunit;

namespace SimpleApp.Tests
{
    public class ProductTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void CanChangeProductName()
        {
            // Arrange
            var p = new Product { Name = "Test", Price = 100M };
            // Act
            p.Name = "New Name";
            //Assert
            Assert.Equal("New Name", p.Name);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void CanChangeProductPrice()
        {
            // Arrange
            var p = new Product { Name = "Test", Price = 100M };
            // Act
            p.Price = 200M;
            //Assert
            Assert.Equal(200M, p.Price);
        }
    }
}
