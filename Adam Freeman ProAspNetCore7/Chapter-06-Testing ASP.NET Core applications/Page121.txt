Listing 6.1 Creating the Example Project

dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 6.0.100 --output Testing/SimpleApp
dotnet new web --no-https --output Testing/SimpleApp --framework net6.0
dotnet new sln -o Testing

dotnet sln Testing add Testing/SimpleApp

These commands create a new project named SimpleApp using the web template, 
which contains the minimal configuration for ASP.NET Core applications. 
The project folder is contained within a solution folder also called Testing.

6.1.1	Opening the Project

If you are using Visual Studio, select File ➤ Open ➤ Project/Solution, 
select the Testing.sln file in the Testing folder, and click the Open button 
to open the solution file and the project it references. If you are using 
Visual Studio Code, select File ➤ Open Folder, navigate to the Testing 
folder, and click the Select Folder button.

6.1.2	Selecting the HTTP Port

Set the port on which ASP.NET Core will receive HTTP requests by editing 
the launchSettings.json file in the Properties folder, as shown 
in Listing 6-2.
