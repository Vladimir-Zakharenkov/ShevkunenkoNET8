Listing 4-16. Installing the LibMan Tool Package

dotnet tool uninstall --global Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli --version 2.1.113

These commands remove any existing LibMan package and install the version that 
is used throughout this book. The next step is to initialize the project, 
which creates the file that LibMan uses to keep track of the client packages 
it installs. Run the command shown in Listing 4-17 in the MyProject folder 
to initialize the example project.

Listing 4-17. Initializing the Example Project

libman init -p cdnjs

LibMan can download packages from different repositories. The -p argument 
in Listing 4-17 specifies the repository at https://cdnjs.com, which is 
the most widely used. Once the project is initialized, clientside
packages can be installed. To install the Bootstrap CSS framework that I use 
to style HTML content throughout this book, run the command shown in 
Listing 4-18 in the MyProject folder.

Listing 4.18 Installing the Bootstrap CSS framework

libman install bootstrap@5.2.3 -d wwwroot/lib/bootstrap

The command installs version 5.2.3 of the Bootstrap package, which is known by the
name bootstrap on the CDNJS repository. The -d argument specifies the location
into which the package is installed. The convention in ASP.NET Core projects is to
install client-side packages into the wwwroot/lib folder.

Once the package has been installed, add the classes shown in listing 4.19 to the elements
in the demo.html file. This is how the features provided by the Bootstrap package
are applied.

NOTE
I don’t get into the details of using the Bootstrap CSS framework in this
book. See https://getbootstrap.com for the Bootstrap documentation.
