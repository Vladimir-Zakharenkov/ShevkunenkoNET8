44.2.1	Understanding Item Scaffolding

The item templates presented by Visual Studio can be useful, especially for 
C# classes where it sets the namespace and class name automatically. 
But Visual Studio also provides scaffolded items, which I recommend against 
using. The Add ➤ New Scaffolded Item leads to a selection of items that guide 
you through a process to add more complex items. Visual Studio will also offer 
individual scaffolded items based on the name of the folder that you are adding 
an item to. For example, if you right-click a folder named Views, Visual Studio 
will helpfully add scaffolded items to the top of the menu, as shown in Figure 4-3.

The View and Controller items are scaffolded, and selecting them will present 
you with choices that determine the content of the items you create.

Just like the project templates, I recommend against using scaffolded items, 
at least until you understand the content they create. In this book, I use 
only the Add ➤ New Item menu for the examples and change the placeholder 
content immediately.

4.3	Building and Running Projects

The simplest way to build and run a project is to use the command-line tools. 
To prepare, add the statement shown in Listing 4-4 to the Program.cs class file 
in the MyProject folder.
