CHAPTER 4

Using the Development Tools

This chapter covers

•	Using command-line tools to create an ASP.NET Core project
•	Adding code and content to a project
•	Building and running an ASP.NET Core project
•	Using the hot reload feature
•	Installing NuGet packages
•	Installing tool packages
•	Installing client-side packages
•	Using the debugger

In this chapter, I introduce the tools that Microsoft provides for ASP.NET Core 
development and that are used throughout this book.

Unlike earlier editions of this book, I rely on the command-line tools provided 
by the .NET SDK and additional tool packages that Microsoft publishes. In part, 
I have done this to help ensure you get the expected results from the examples 
but also because the command-line tools provide access to all the features 
required for ASP.NET Core development, regardless of which editor/IDE 
you have chosen.

Visual Studio — and, to a lesser extent, Visual Studio Code — offers access 
to some of the tools through user interfaces, which I describe in this chapter, 
but Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code don’t support all the features that are 
required for ASP.NET Core development, so there are times that using the command
line is inevitable.
