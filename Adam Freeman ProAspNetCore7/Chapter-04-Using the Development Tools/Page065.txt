Listing 4-4. Adding a Statement in the Program.cs File in the MyProject Folder

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.Run();

}

This statement adds support for responding to HTTP requests with static content 
in the wwwroot folder, such as the HTML file created in the previous section. 
(I explain this feature in more detail in Chapter 15.) Next, set the HTTP port 
that ASP.NET Core will use to receive HTTP requests, as shown in Listing 4-5.

Listing 4-5. Setting the HTTP Port in the launchSettings.json File in the Properties Folder

{
	"iisSettings": {
		"windowsAuthentication": false,
		"anonymousAuthentication": true,
		"iisExpress": {
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
			"sslPort": 0
		}
	},
	"profiles": {
		"MyProject": {
			"commandName": "Project",
			"dotnetRunMessages": true,
			"launchBrowser": true,
			"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
			"environmentVariables": {
				"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
				}
		},
		"IIS Express": {
			"commandName": "IISExpress",
			"launchBrowser": true,
			"environmentVariables": {
				"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
			}
		}
	}
}

To build the example project, run the command shown in Listing 4-6 
in the MyProject or MySolution folder.

Listing 4.6 Building the project
