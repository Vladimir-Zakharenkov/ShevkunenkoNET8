Right-click the My Project item in the list of files and select New Folder 
from the pop-up menu. Set the name to wwwroot, which is where static content 
is stored in ASP.NET Core projects. Press Enter, and a folder named wwwroot 
will be added to the project. Right-click the new wwwroot folder, select 
New File, and set the name to demo.html. Press Enter to create the HTML 
file and add the content shown in Listing 4-3.

Visual Studio provides a more comprehensive approach that can be helpful 
but only when used selectively. To create a folder, right-click the MyProject 
item in the Solution Explorer and select Add ➤ New Folder from the pop-up menu. 
Set the name of the new item to wwwroot and press Enter; Visual Studio will
create the folder.

Right-click the new wwwroot item in the Solution Explorer and select Add ➤ New Item 
from the pop-up menu. Visual Studio will present you with an extensive selection 
of templates for adding items to the project. These templates can be searched 
using the text field in the top-right corner of the window or filtered using 
the categories on the left of the window. The item template for an HTML 
file is named HTML Page, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Enter demo.html in the Name field, click the Add button to create the new file, 
and replace the contents with the element shown in Listing 4-3. (If you omit 
the file extension, Visual Studio will add it for you based on the item 
template you have selected. If you entered just demo into the Name field 
when you created the  file, Visual Studio would have created a file with 
the .html extension because you had selected the HTML Page item template.)
