Opening the Project

To open the project, start Visual Studio, select Open a Project or Solution, 
and open the MySolution.sln file in the MySolution folder. Visual Studio will 
open the solution file, discover the reference to the project that
was added by the final command in Listing 4-2, and open the project as well.

Visual Studio Code works differently. Start Visual Studio Code, select 
File ➤ Open Folder, and navigate to the MySolution folder. Click Select Folder, 
and Visual Studio Code will open the project.

Although Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio are working with the same project, 
each displays the contents differently. Visual Studio Code shows you a simple 
list of files, ordered alphabetically, as shown on the left of Figure 4-1. 
Visual Studio hides some files and nests others within related file items, 
as shown on the right of Figure 4-1.

There are buttons at the top of the Visual Studio Solution Explorer that 
disable file nesting and show the hidden items in the project. When you open 
a project for the first time in Visual Studio Code, you may be
prompted to add assets for building and debugging the project. 
Click the Yes button.

4.2	Adding Code and Content to Projects

If you are using Visual Studio Code, then you add items to the project 
by right-clicking the folder that should contain the file and selecting 
New File from the pop-up menu (or selecting New Folder if you are adding a
folder).

Note
You are responsible for ensuring that the file extension matches the type 
of item you want to add; for example, an HTML file must be added with 
the .html extension. I give the complete file name and the name
of the containing folder for every item added to a project throughout 
this book, so you will always know exactly what files you need to add.
