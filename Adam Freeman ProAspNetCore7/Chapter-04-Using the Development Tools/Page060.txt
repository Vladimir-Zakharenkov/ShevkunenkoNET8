Listing 4-1. Listing the .NET Templates

dotnet new --list

Each template has a short name that makes it easier to use. There are many 
templates available, but Table 4-2 describes the ones that are most useful 
for creating ASP.NET Core projects.

There are also templates that create commonly required files used to configure projects, 
as described in Table 4-3.

UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITATIONS OF PROJECT TEMPLATES

The project templates described in Table 4-2 are intended to help jump-start 
development by taking care of basic configuration settings and adding 
placeholder content.

These templates can give you a sense of rapid progress, but they contain assumptions 
about how a project should be configured and developed. If you don’t understand 
the impact of those assumptions, you won’t be able to get the results you require 
for the specific demands of your project.

The web template creates a project with the minimum configuration required for ASP.NET Core
development. This is the project template I use for most of the examples in this book 
so that I can explain how each feature is configured and how the features 
can be used together.

Once you understand how ASP.NET Core works, the other project templates can be useful 
because you will know how to adapt them to your needs. But, while you are learning, 
I recommend sticking to the web template, even though it can take a little more 
effort to get results.
