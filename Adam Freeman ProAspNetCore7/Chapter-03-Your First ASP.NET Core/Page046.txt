The new action method is called ListResponses, and it calls the View method, 
using the Repository.Responses property as the argument. This will cause Razor 
to render the default view, using the action method name as the name of the view file, 
and to use the data from the repository as the view model. The view model data is 
filtered using LINQ so that only positive responses are provided to the view.

Add a Razor View named ListResponses.cshtml to the Views/Home folder with 
the content shown in Listing 3-16.
