Styling the Content

All the functional goals for the application are complete, but the overall 
appearance of the application is poor. When you create a project using 
the mvc template, as I did for the example in this chapter, some common 
client-side development packages are installed. While I am not a fan of 
using template projects, I do like the client-side libraries that Microsoft 
has chosen. One of them is called Bootstrap, which is a good CSS framework 
originally developed by Twitter that has become a major open-source project 
and a mainstay of web application development.

Styling the Welcome View

The basic Bootstrap features work by applying classes to elements that correspond 
to CSS selectors defined in the files added to the wwwroot/lib/bootstrap folder. 
You can get full details of the classes that Bootstrap defines from http://getbootstrap.com, 
but you can see how I have applied some basic styling to the Index.cshtml 
view file in Listing 3-22.

Listing 3-22. Adding Bootstrap to the Index.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
	<title>Index</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="text-center m-2">
		<h3> We're going to have an exciting party!</h3>

		<h4>And YOU are invited!</h4>

		<a class="btn btn-primary" asp-action="RsvpForm">RSVP Now</a>
	</div>
</body>
</html>

I have added a link element whose href attribute loads the bootstrap.css file 
from the wwwroot/lib/bootstrap/dist/css folder. The convention is that third-party 
CSS and JavaScript packages are installed into the wwwroot/lib folder, and 
I describe the tool that is used to manage these packages in Chapter 4.

Having imported the Bootstrap stylesheets, I need to style my elements. 
This is a simple example, so I need to use only a small number of Bootstrap 
CSS classes: text-center, btn, and btn-primary.

The text-center class centers the contents of an element and its children. 
The btn class styles a button, input, or a element as a pretty button, and 
the btn-primary class specifies which of a range of colors I want the button 
to be. You can see the effect by running the application, 
as shown in Figure 3-10.
