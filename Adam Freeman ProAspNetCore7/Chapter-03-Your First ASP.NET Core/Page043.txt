The HTML produced by the Thanks.cshtml view depends on the values assigned 
to the GuestResponse view model provided by the RsvpForm action method. 
To access the value of a property in the domain object, I use an @Model.<PropertyName> 
expression. So, for example, to get the value of the Name property, I use the
@Model.Name expression. Don’t worry if the Razor syntax doesn’t make sense — 
I explain it in more detail in Chapter 21.

Now that I have created the Thanks view, I have a basic working example of handling 
a form. Use the browser to request http://localhost:5000, click the RSVP Now link,
add some data to the form, and click the Submit RSVP button. You will see the response 
shown in Figure 3-5 (although it will differ if your name is not Joe or you said you 
could not attend).
