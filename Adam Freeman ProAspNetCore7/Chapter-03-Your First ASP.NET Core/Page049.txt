The asp-validation-summary attribute is applied to a div element, and it displays 
a list of validation errors when the view is rendered. The value for the 
asp-validation-summary attribute is a value from an enumeration called ValidationSummary, 
which specifies what types of validation errors the summary will contain. I specified All, 
which is a good starting point for most applications, and I describe the other values
and explain how they work in Chapter 29.

To see how the validation summary works, run the application, fill out the Name field, 
and submit the form without entering any other data. You will see a summary of 
validation errors, as shown in Figure 3-7.

The RsvpForm action method will not render the Thanks view until all the validation 
constraints applied to the GuestResponse class have been satisfied. Notice that 
the data entered in the Name field was preserved and displayed again when Razor 
rendered the view with the validation summary. This is another benefit of
model binding, and it simplifies working with form data.

Highlighting Invalid Fields

The tag helper attributes that associate model properties with elements have a handy 
feature that can be used in conjunction with model binding. When a model class property 
has failed validation, the helper attributes will generate slightly different HTML. 
Here is the input element that is generated for the Phone field when there is 
no validation error:

<input type="text" data-val="true"
	data-val-required="Please enter your phone number" id="Phone"
	name="Phone" value="">

For comparison, here is the same HTML element after the user has submitted the form 
without entering data into the text field (which is a validation error because 
I applied the Required attribute to the Phone property of the GuestResponse class):

<input type="text" class="input-validation-error"
	data-val="true" data-val-required="Please enter your phone number" id="Phone"
	name="Phone" value="">
