The Controller base class provides a property called ModelState that provides 
details of the outcome of the model binding process. If the ModelState.IsValid 
property returns true, then I know that the model binder has been able to satisfy 
the validation constraints I specified through the attributes on the GuestResponse class. 
When this happens, I render the Thanks view, just as I did previously.

If the ModelState.IsValid property returns false, then I know that there are 
validation errors. The object returned by the ModelState property provides 
details of each problem that has been encountered, but I don’t need to get into 
that level of detail because I can rely on a useful feature that automates 
the process of asking the user to address any problems by calling the View 
method without any parameters.

When it renders a view, Razor has access to the details of any validation 
errors associated with the request, and tag helpers can access the details 
to display validation errors to the user. Listing 3-19 shows the
addition of validation tag helper attributes to the RsvpForm view.
