ASP.NET Core detects the attributes and uses them to validate data during 
the model-binding process.

As noted earlier, I used nullable types to define the GuestResponse properties. 
This is useful for denoting properties that may not be assigned values, 
but it has a special value for the WillAttend property because it allows 
the Required validation attribute to work. If I had used a regular non-nullable bool, 
the value I received through model binding could be only true or false, 
and I would not be able to tell whether the user had selected a value. 
A nullable bool has three possible values: true, false, and null. The value
of the WillAttend property will be null if the user has not selected a value, 
and this causes the Required attribute to report a validation error. 
This is a nice example of how ASP.NET Core elegantly blends C# features 
with HTML and HTTP.

I check to see whether there has been a validation problem using 
the ModelState.IsValid property in the action method that receives 
the form data, as shown in Listing 3-18.

Listing 3-18. Checking for Validation Errors in the HomeController.cs File 
	in the Controllers Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using PartyInvites.Models;

namespace PartyInvites.Controllers {
	public class HomeController : Controller {

		public IActionResult Index() {
			return View();
		}

		[HttpGet]
		public ViewResult RsvpForm() {
			return View();
		}

		[HttpPost]
		public ViewResult RsvpForm(GuestResponse guestResponse) {
			if (ModelState.IsValid) {
				Repository.AddResponse(guestResponse);
				return View("Thanks", guestResponse);
			} else {
				return View();
			}
		}

		public ViewResult ListResponses() {
			return View(Repository.Responses.Where(r => r.WillAttend == true));
		}
	}
}
