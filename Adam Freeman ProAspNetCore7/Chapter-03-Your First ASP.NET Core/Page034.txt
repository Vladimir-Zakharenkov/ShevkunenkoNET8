Once the project has started, a new browser window will be opened, and 
you will see the details of the party (well, the placeholder for the details, 
but you get the idea), as shown in Figure 3-1.

Leave the dotnet watch command running. As you make changes to the project, 
you will see that the code is automatically recompiled and that changes 
are automatically displayed in the browser.

If you make a mistake following the examples, 
you may find that the dotnet watch command indicates that it can’t automatically 
update the browser. If that happens, select the option to restart the application.

3.2.2	Adding a Data Model

The data model is the most important part of any ASP.NET Core application. 
The model is the representation of the real-world objects, processes, and rules 
that define the subject, known as the domain, of the application. The model, 
often referred to as a domain model, contains the C# objects (known as domain
objects) that make up the universe of the application and the methods that 
manipulate them. In most projects, the job of the ASP.NET Core application 
is to provide the user with access to the data model and the features that 
allow the user to interact with it.

The convention for an ASP.NET Core application is that the data model classes 
are defined in a folder named Models, which was added to the project by the 
template used in Listing 3-1.

I don’t need a complex model for the PartyInvites project because it is 
such a simple application. I need just one domain class that I will call 
GuestResponse. This object will represent an RSVP from an invitee.
