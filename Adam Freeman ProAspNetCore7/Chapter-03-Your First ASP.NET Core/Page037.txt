3.2.4	Linking Action Methods

I want to be able to create a link from the Index view so that guests can see 
the RsvpForm view without having to know the URL that targets a specific action 
method, as shown in Listing 3-9.

Listing 3-9. Adding a Link in the Index.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<title>Party!</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div>
		<div>
			We're going to have an exciting party.<br />
			(To do: sell it better. Add pictures or something.)
		</div>
		<a asp-action="RsvpForm">RSVP Now</a>
	</div>
</body>
</html>

The addition to the listing is an a element that has an asp-action attribute. 
The attribute is an example of a tag helper attribute, which is an instruction 
for Razor that will be performed when the view is rendered. The asp-action attribute 
is an instruction to add an href attribute to the a element that contains a URL for
an action method. I explain how tag helpers work in Chapters 25–27, but this tag helper 
tells Razor to insert a URL for an action method defined by the same controller 
for which the current view is being rendered.

Use the browser to request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the link that 
the helper has created, as shown in Figure 3-3.

Roll the mouse over the RSVP Now link in the browser. You will see that the link 
points to the following URL:

http://localhost:5000/Home/RsvpForm
