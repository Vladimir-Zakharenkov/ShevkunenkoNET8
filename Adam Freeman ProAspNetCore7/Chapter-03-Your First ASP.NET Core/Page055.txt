The Bootstrap classes in this example create a header, just to give structure 
to the layout. To style the form, I have used the form-group class, which is used 
to style the element that contains the label and the associated input or select 
element, which is assigned to the form-control class. You can see the effect of 
the styles in Figure 3-11.
