I have highlighted the difference: the asp-for tag helper attribute added the input 
element to a class called input-validation-error. I can take advantage of this 
feature by creating a stylesheet that contains CSS styles for this class and 
the others that different HTML helper attributes use.

The convention in ASP.NET Core projects is that static content is placed into 
the wwwroot folder and organized by content type so that CSS stylesheets go into 
the wwwroot/css folder, JavaScript files go into the wwwroot/js folder, and so on.

Tip
The project template used in Listing 3-1 creates a site.css file in the wwwroot/css 
folder. You can ignore this file, which I don’t use in this chapter.

If you are using Visual Studio, right-click the wwwroot/css folder and select 
Add ➤ New Item from the pop-up menu. Locate the Style Sheet item template, 
as shown in Figure 3-8; set the name of the file to styles.css; and click 
the Add button.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, right-click the wwwroot/css folder, select 
New File from the pop-up menu, and use styles.css as the file name. Regardless 
of which editor you use, replace the contents of the file with the styles 
shown in Listing 3-20.
