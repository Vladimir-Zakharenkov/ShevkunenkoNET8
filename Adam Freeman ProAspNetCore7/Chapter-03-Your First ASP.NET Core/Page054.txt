Figure 3-10. Styling a view
(https://sergeyshef.ru/img/freeman-asp-net-core-6/Figure-3-10.png)


It will be obvious to you that I am not a web designer. In fact, as a child, 
I was excused from art lessons on the basis that I had absolutely no talent 
whatsoever. This had the happy result of making more time for math lessons 
but meant that my artistic skills have not developed beyond those of 
the average 10-year-old. For a real project, I would seek a professional 
to help design and style the content, but for this example, I am going it alone, 
and that means applying Bootstrap with as much restraint and consistency as 
I can muster.

Styling the Form View

Bootstrap defines classes that can be used to style forms. I am not going to go 
into detail, but you can see how I have applied these classes in Listing 3-23.
