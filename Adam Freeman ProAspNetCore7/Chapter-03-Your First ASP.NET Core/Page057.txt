Styling the List View

The final view to style is ListResponses, which presents the list of attendees. 
Styling the content follows the same approach as used for the other views, 
as shown in Listing 3-25.

Listing 3-25. Adding Bootstrap to the ListResponses.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

@model IEnumerable<PartyInvites.Models.GuestResponse>

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<title>Responses</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
</head>
<body>
	<div class="text-center p-2">
		<h2 class="text-center">
			Here is the list of people attending the party
		</h2>

		<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-sm">
			<thead>
				<tr><th>Name</th><th>Email</th><th>Phone</th></tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				@foreach (PartyInvites.Models.GuestResponse r in Model!) {
				<tr>
					<td>@r.Name</td>
					<td>@r.Email</td>
					<td>@r.Phone</td>
				</tr>
			}
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>
</body>
</html>

Figure 3-13 shows the way that the table of attendees is presented. Adding 
these styles to the view completes the example application, which now meets 
all the development goals and has an improved appearance.
