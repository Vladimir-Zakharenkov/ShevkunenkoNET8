Summary

•	ASP.NET Core projects are created with the dotnet new command.

•	Controllers define action methods that are used to handle HTTP requests.

•	Views generate HTML content that is used to respond to HTTP requests.

•	Views can contain HTML elements that are bound to data model properties.

•	Model binding is the process by which request data is parsed and assigned to the
	properties of objects that are passed to action methods for processing.

•	The data in the request can be subjected to validation and errors can be displayed
	to the user within the same HTML form that was used to submit the data.

•	The HTML content generated by views can be styled using the same CSS features
	that are applied to static HTML content.
