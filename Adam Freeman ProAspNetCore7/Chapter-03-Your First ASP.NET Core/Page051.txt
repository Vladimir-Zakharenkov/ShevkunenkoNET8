To apply this stylesheet, I added a link element to the head section of the RsvpForm 
view, as shown in Listing 3-21.

Listing 3-21. Applying a Stylesheet in the RsvpForm.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

...
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
<title>RsvpForm</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
</head>
...

The link element uses the href attribute to specify the location of the stylesheet. 
Notice that the wwwroot folder is omitted from the URL. The default configuration 
for ASP.NET includes support for serving static content, such as images, CSS stylesheets, 
and JavaScript files, and it maps requests to the wwwroot folder automatically. 
With the application of the stylesheet, a more obvious validation error will be displayed
when data is submitted that causes a validation error, as shown in Figure 3-9.
