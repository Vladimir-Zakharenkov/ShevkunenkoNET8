Both action methods invoke the View method without arguments, which may seem odd, 
but remember that the Razor view engine will use the name of the action method 
when looking for a view file, as explained in Chapter 2. That means the result 
from the Index action method tells Razor to look for a view called Index.cshtml, 
while the result from the RsvpForm action method tells Razor to look for a view 
called RsvpForm.cshtml.

If you are using Visual Studio, right-click the Views/Home folder and select 
Add ➤ New Item from the pop-up menu. Select the Razor View - Empty item, set 
the name to RsvpForm.cshtml, and click the Add button to create the file. 
Replace the contents with those shown in Listing 3-8.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, right-click the Views/Home folder and select 
New File from the pop-up menu. Set the name of the file to RsvpForm.cshtml and 
add the contents shown in Listing 3-8.

Listing 3-8. The Contents of the RsvpForm.cshtml File in the Views/Home Folder

@{
	Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<title>RsvpForm</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div>
		This is the RsvpForm.cshtml View
	</div>
</body>
</html>

This content is just static HTML for the moment. Use the browser to request 
http://localhost:5000/home/rsvpform. The Razor view engine locates the RsvpForm.cshtml 
file and uses it to produce a response, as shown in Figure 3-2.
