	•	A home page that shows information about the party
	•	A form that can be used to RSVP
	•	Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page
	•	A summary page that shows who is coming to the party

In this chapter, I create an ASP.NET Core project and use it to create a simple 
application that contains these features; once everything works, I’ll apply some 
styling to improve the appearance of the finished application.

3.2	Creating the Project

Open a PowerShell command prompt from the Windows Start menu, navigate to a convenient 
location, and run the commands in Listing 3-1 to create a project named PartyInvites.

Tip
You can download the example project for this chapter — and for all the other 
chapters in this book from https://github.com/manningbooks/pro-asp.net-core-7.
See Chapter 1 for how to get help if you have problems running the examples.

Listing 3-1. Creating a New Project

dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 7.0.100 --output PartyInvites
dotnet new mvc --no-https --output PartyInvites --framework net7.0
dotnet new sln -o PartyInvites
dotnet sln PartyInvites add PartyInvites

These are the same commands I used to create the project in Chapter 2. 
These commands ensure you get the right project starting point that 
uses the required version of .NET.

3.2.1	Preparing the Project

Open the project (by opening the PartyInvites.sln file with Visual Studio 
or the PartyInvites folder in Visual Studio Code) and change the contents 
of the launchSettings.json file in the Properties folder, as shown in 
Listing 3-2, to set the port that will be used to listen for HTTP requests.
