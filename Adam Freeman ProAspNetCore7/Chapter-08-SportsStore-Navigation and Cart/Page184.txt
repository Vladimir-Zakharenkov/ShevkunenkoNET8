8.1.3		Building a Category Navigation Menu

I need to provide users with a way to select a category that does not involve typing in URLs. 
This means presenting a list of the available categories and indicating which, if any, 
is currently selected.

ASP.NET Core has the concept of view components, which are perfect for creating items such 
as reusable navigation controls. A view component is a C# class that provides a small 
amount of reusable application logic with the ability to select and display Razor partial views. 
I describe view components in detail in Chapter 24.

In this case, I will create a view component that renders the navigation menu and integrate 
it into the application by invoking the component from the shared layout. This approach gives 
me a regular C# class that can contain whatever application logic I need and that can be unit 
tested like any other class.

Creating the Navigation View Component

I created a folder called Components, which is the conventional home of view components, 
in the SportsStore project and added to it a class file named NavigationMenuViewComponent.cs, 
which I used to define the class shown in Listing 8-6.

Listing 8.6     The Contents of the NavigationMenuViewComponent.cs File in the SportsStore/Components Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace SportsStore.Components
{
    public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
    {
        public string Invoke()
        {
            return "Hello from the Nav View Component";
        }
    }
}
