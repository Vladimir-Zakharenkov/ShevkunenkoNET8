8.1.4		Correcting the Page Count

I need to correct the page links so that they work correctly when a category is selected. 
Currently, the number of page links is determined by the total number of products in 
the repository and not the number of products in the selected category. This means that 
the customer can click the link for page 2 of the Chess category and end up with an empty 
page because there are not enough chess products to fill two pages. You can see the problem 
in Figure 8.6.

Figure 8.6 Displaying the wrong page links when a category is selected

I can fix this by updating the Index action method in the Home controller so that 
the pagination information takes the categories into account, as shown in Listing 8.12.

Listing 8.12    Creating Category Pagination Data in the HomeController.cs File in the SportsStore/Controllers Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using SportsStore.Models;
using SportsStore.Models.ViewModels;

namespace SportsStore.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private IStoreRepository repository;

        public int PageSize = 4;

        public HomeController(IStoreRepository repo)
        {
            repository = repo;
        }

        public ViewResult Index(string? category, int productPage = 1) =>
            View(new ProductsListViewModel
            {
                Products = repository.Products
                    .Where(p => category == null || p.Category == category)
                    .OrderBy(p => p.ProductID)
                    .Skip((productPage - 1) * PageSize)
                    .Take(PageSize),

                PagingInfo = new PagingInfo
                {
                    CurrentPage = productPage,
                    ItemsPerPage = PageSize,
                    TotalItems = category == null
                        ? repository.Products.Count() : repository.Products.Where(e => e.Category == category).Count()
                },

                CurrentCategory = category
            });
    }
}
