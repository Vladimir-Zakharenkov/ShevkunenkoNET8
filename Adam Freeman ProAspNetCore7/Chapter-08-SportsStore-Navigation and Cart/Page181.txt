8.1.2   Refining the URL Scheme

No one wants to see or use ugly URLs such as /?category=Soccer. To address this, 
I am going to change the routing configuration in the Configure method of the Program.cs 
file to create a more useful set of URLs, as shown in Listing 8.3.

Listing 8.3     Changing the Routing Schema in the Program.cs File in the SportsStore Folder

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using SportsStore.Models;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.AddDbContext<StoreDbContext>(opts =>
{
    opts.UseSqlServer(
    builder.Configuration["ConnectionStrings:SportsStoreConnection"]);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped<IStoreRepository, EFStoreRepository>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.MapControllerRoute("catpage", "{category}/Page{productPage:int}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

app.MapControllerRoute("page", "Page{productPage:int}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapControllerRoute("category", "{category}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapControllerRoute("pagination", "Products/Page{productPage}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

SeedData.EnsurePopulated(app);

app.Run();

Table 8.1 describes the URL scheme that these routes represent. I explain the routing system in detail in Chapter 13.

The ASP.NET Core routing system handles incoming requests from clients, but it also generates 
outgoing URLs that conform to the URL scheme and that can be embedded in web pages. By using 
the routing system both to handle incoming requests and to generate outgoing URLs, I can ensure 
that all the URLs in the application are consistent.

The IUrlHelper interface provides access to URL-generating functionality. I used this interface 
and the Action method it defines in the tag helper I created in the previous chapter. Now that 
I want to start generating more complex URLs, I need a way to receive additional information 
from the view without having to add extra properties to the tag helper class. Fortunately, 
tag helpers have a nice feature that allows properties with a common prefix to be received 
all together in a single collection, as shown in Listing 8.4.
