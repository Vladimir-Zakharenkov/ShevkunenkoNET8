Understanding Razor Pages

Razor Pages can feel a little odd when you first start using them, especially if you have previous
experience with the MVC Framework features provided by ASP.NET Core. But Razor Pages are
complementary to the MVC Framework, and I find myself using them alongside controllers and views
because they are well-suited to self-contained features that don’t require the complexity of the MVC
Framework. I describe Razor Pages in Chapter 23 and show their use alongside controllers throughout
Part 3 and Part 4 of this book.

The result is that the basic functions of the shopping cart are in place. First, products are listed along
with a button to add them to the cart, which you can see by restarting ASP.NET Core and requesting 
http://localhost:5000, as shown in Figure 8.10.

Second, when the user clicks an Add To Cart button, the appropriate product is added to their cart, and
a summary of the cart is displayed, as shown in Figure 8-11. Clicking the Continue Shopping button returns
the user to the product page they came from.
