Note
Notice that I have set the method attribute on the form element to post, which instructs the browser
to submit the form data using an HTTP POST request. You can change this so that forms use the GET method,
but you should think carefully about doing so. The HTTP specification requires that GET requests be idempotent,
meaning that they must not cause changes, and adding a product to a cart is definitely a change.

8.2.4   Enabling Sessions

I am going to store details of a user’s cart using session state, which is data associated with a series of requests
made by a user. ASP.NET provides a range of different ways to store session state, including storing it in
memory, which is the approach that I am going to use. This has the advantage of simplicity, but it means
that the session data is lost when the application is stopped or restarted. Enabling sessions requires adding
services and middleware in the Program.cs file, as shown in Listing 8.21.

using SportsStore.Models;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.AddDbContext<StoreDbContext>(opts =>
{
    opts.UseSqlServer(
    builder.Configuration["ConnectionStrings:SportsStoreConnection"]);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped<IStoreRepository, EFStoreRepository>();

builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

builder.Services.AddSession();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseSession();

app.MapControllerRoute("catpage", "{category}/Page{productPage:int}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

app.MapControllerRoute("page", "Page{productPage:int}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapControllerRoute("category", "{category}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapControllerRoute("pagination", "Products/Page{productPage}", new { Controller = "Home", action = "Index", productPage = 1 });

app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

app.MapRazorPages();

SeedData.EnsurePopulated(app);

app.Run();
