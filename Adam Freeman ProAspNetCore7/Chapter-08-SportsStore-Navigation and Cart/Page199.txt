Add a folder named Pages, which is the conventional location for Razor Pages, to the SportsStore
project. Add a Razor View Imports file named _ViewImports.cshtml to the Pages folder with 
the content shown in Listing 8-14. These expressions set the namespace that the Razor Pages 
will belong to and allow the SportsStore classes to be used in Razor Pages without needing 
to specify their namespace.

Listing 8-14. The Contents of the _ViewImports.cshtml File 
in the SportsStore/Pages Folder

@namespace SportsStore.Pages
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages
@using SportsStore.Models
@using SportsStore.Infrastructure
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

Next, add a Razor View Start file named _ViewStart.cshtml to the Pages folder, with the content 
shown in Listing 8-15. Razor Pages have their own configuration files, and this one specifies 
that the Razor Pages in the SportsStore project will use a layout file named _CartLayout 
by default.

Listing 8-15. The Contents of the _ViewStart.cshtml File 
in the SportsStore/Pages Folder

@{
	Layout = "_CartLayout";
}

Finally, to provide the layout the Razor Pages will use, add a Razor View named _CartLayout.cshtml to
the Pages folder with the content shown in Listing 8-16.

Listing 8-16. The Contents of the _CartLayout.cshtml File 
in the SportsStore/Pages Folder

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>SportsStore</title>
    <link href="/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
    <div class="bg-dark text-white p-2">
        <span class="navbar-brand ml-2">SPORTS STORE</span>
    </div>
    <div class="m-1 p-1">
        @RenderBody()
    </div>
</body>
</html>

Creating a Razor Page

If you are using Visual Studio, use the Razor Page template item and set the item name 
to Cart.cshtml. This will create a Cart.cshtml file and a Cart.cshtml.cs class file. 
Replace the contents of the file with those shown in Listing 8-17. If you are using 
Visual Studio Code, just create a Cart.cshtml file with the content
shown in Listing 8-17.
