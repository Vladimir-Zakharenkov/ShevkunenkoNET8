I made three changes to the action method. First, I added a parameter called category. 
This category parameter is used by the second change in the listing, which is an enhancement 
to the LINQ query: if category is not null, only those Product objects with a matching 
Category property are selected. The last change is to set the value of the CurrentCategory 
property I added to the ProductsListViewModel class. However, these changes mean that 
the value of PagingInfo.TotalItems is incorrectly calculated because it
doesn’t take the category filter into account. I will fix this in a while.
