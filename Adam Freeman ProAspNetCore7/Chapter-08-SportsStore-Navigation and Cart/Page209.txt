The class associated with a Razor Page is known as its page model class, and it defines handler methods
that are invoked for different types of HTTP requests, which update state before rendering the view. The
page model class in Listing 8-25, which is named CartModel, defines an OnPost hander method, which is
invoked to handle HTTP POST requests. It does this by retrieving a Product from the database, retrieving the
user’s Cart from the session data, and updating its content using the Product. The modified Cart is stored,
and the browser is redirected to the same Razor Page, which it will do using a GET request (which prevents
reloading the browser from triggering a duplicate POST request).

The GET request is handled by the OnGet handler method, which sets the values of the ReturnUrl and
Cart properties, after which the Razor content section of the page is rendered. The expressions in the HTML
content are evaluated using the CartModel as the view model object, which means that the values assigned
to the ReturnUrl and Cart properties can be accessed within the expressions. The content generated by the
Razor Page details the products added to the user’s cart and provides a button to navigate back to the point
where the product was added to the cart.
