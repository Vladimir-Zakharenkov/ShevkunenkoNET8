CHAPTER 8

SportsStore: Navigation and Cart

This chapter covers

•	Navigating between product categories
•	Correcting the pagination controls to support category navigation
•	Using sessions to store data between requests
•	Implementing a shopping cart using session data
•	Displaying the shopping cart contents using Razor Pages

In this chapter, I continue to build out the SportsStore example app. I add support for navigating 
around the application and start building a shopping cart.

Tip
You can download the example project for this chapter—and for all the other chapters in this book—
from https://github.com/manningbooks/pro-asp.net-core-7. See Chapter 1 for how to get help if you have
problems running the examples.

8.1	Adding Navigation Controls

The SportsStore application will be more useful if customers can navigate products 
by category. I will do this in three phases.

	•   Enhance the Index action method in the HomeController class so that it can filter
		the Product objects in the repository

	•   Revisit and enhance the URL scheme

	•   Create a category list that will go into the sidebar of the site, highlighting the
		current category and linking to others
