8.2	Building the Shopping Cart

The application is progressing nicely, but I cannot sell any products until I implement 
a shopping cart. In this section, I will create the shopping cart experience shown 
in Figure 8.8. This will be familiar to anyone who has ever made a purchase online.

An Add To Cart button will be displayed alongside each of the products in the catalog. 
Clicking this button will show a summary of the products the customer has selected so far, 
including the total cost. At this point, the user can click the Continue Shopping button 
to return to the product catalog or click the Checkout Now button to complete the order 
and finish the shopping session.
