Summary

In this chapter, I started to flesh out the customer-facing parts of the SportsStore app. I provided the means
by which the user can navigate by category and put the basic building blocks in place for adding items to
a shopping cart. I have more work to do, and I continue the development of the application in the next
chapter.
