To see the effect of the category filtering, start ASP.NET Core and select a category using 
the following URL, taking care to use an uppercase S for Soccer:

http://localhost:5000/?category=Soccer

You will see only the products in the Soccer category, as shown in Figure 8-1.

Users won’t want to navigate to categories using URLs, but you can see how small changes 
can have a big impact once the basic structure of an ASP.NET Core application is in place.
