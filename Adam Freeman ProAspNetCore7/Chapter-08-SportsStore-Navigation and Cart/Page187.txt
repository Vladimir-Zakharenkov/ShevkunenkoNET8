Creating the Navigation View Component

I created a folder called Components, which is the conventional home of view components, 
in the SportsStore project and added to it a class file named NavigationMenuViewComponent.cs, 
which I used to define the class shown in Listing 8-6.

Listing 8-6. The Contents of the NavigationMenuViewComponent.cs File in the SportsStore/
Components Folder

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace SportsStore.Components
{
    public class NavigationMenuViewComponent : ViewComponent
    {
        public string Invoke()
        {
            return "Hello from the Nav View Component";
        }
    }
}

The view component’s Invoke method is called when the component is used in a Razor view, and the
result of the Invoke method is inserted into the HTML sent to the browser. I have started 
with a simple view component that returns a string, but I’ll replace this with HTML shortly.

I want the category list to appear on all pages, so I am going to use the view component 
in the shared layout, rather than in a specific view. Within a view, view components are applied 
using a tag helper, as shown in Listing 8-7.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>SportsStore</title>
    <link href="/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>

    <div class="bg-dark text-white p-2">
        <span class="navbar-brand ml-2">SPORTS STORE</span>
    </div>

    <div class="row m-1 p-1">

        <div id="categories" class="col-3">
            <vc:navigation-menu />
        </div>

        <div class="col-9">
            @RenderBody()
        </div>

    </div>

</body>

</html>

I removed the placeholder text and replaced it with the vc:navigation-menu element, which inserts 
the view component. The element omits the ViewComponent part of the class name and hyphenates it, 
such that vc:navigation-menu specifies the NavigationMenuViewComponent class.

Restart ASP.NET Core and request http://localhost:5000, and you will see that the output from the
Invoke method is included in the HTML sent to the browser, as shown in Figure 8-3.
