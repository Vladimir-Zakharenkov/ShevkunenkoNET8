Note
This is the view imports file in the Views folder and not the one added to the Pages folder.

Listing 8-19. Adding a Namespace in the _ViewImports.cshtml File 
in the SportsStore/Views Folder

@using SportsStore.Models
@using SportsStore.Models.ViewModels
@using SportsStore.Infrastructure
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@addTagHelper *, SportsStore

In Listing 8-20, I have updated the partial view that describes each product so that 
it contains an Add To Cart button.

Listing 8-20. Adding the Buttons to the ProductSummary.cshtml File View 
in the SportsStore/Views/Shared Folder

@model Product

<div class="card card-outline-primary m-1 p-1">
    <div class="bg-faded p-1">
        <h4>
            @Model?.Name
            <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-primary text-white"
                  style="float:right">
                <small>@Model?.Price.ToString("c")</small>
            </span>
        </h4>
    </div>

    <form id="@Model?.ProductID" asp-page="/Cart" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" asp-for="ProductID" />
        <input type="hidden" name="returnUrl"
               value="@ViewContext.HttpContext.Request.PathAndQuery()" />
        <span class="card-text p-1">
            @Model?.Description
            <button type="submit"
                    class="btn btn-success btn-sm pull-right" style="float:right">
                Add To Cart
            </button>
        </span>
    </form>
</div>

I have added a form element that contains hidden input elements specifying the ProductID value 
from the view model and the URL that the browser should be returned to after the cart has been 
updated. The form element and one of the input elements are configured using built-in tag helpers, 
which are a useful way of generating forms that contain model values and that target controllers 
or Razor Pages, as described in Chapter 27. The other input element uses the extension method 
I created to set the return URL. I also added a button element that will submit the form 
to the application.
