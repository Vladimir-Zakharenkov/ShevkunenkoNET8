UNIT TEST: TESTING THE CART

The Cart class is relatively simple, but it has a range of important behaviors that must work properly.
A poorly functioning cart would undermine the entire SportsStore application. I have broken down
the features and tested them individually. I created a new unit test file called CartTests.cs in the
SportsStore.Tests project to contain these tests.

The first behavior relates to when I add an item to the cart. If this is the first time that a given Product
has been added to the cart, I want a new CartLine to be added. Here is the test, including the unit test
class definition:

using System.Linq;
using SportsStore.Models;
using Xunit;
namespace SportsStore.Tests
{
    public class CartTests
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Can_Add_New_Lines()
        {
            // Arrange - create some test products
            Product p1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, Name = "P1" };
            Product p2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, Name = "P2" };

            // Arrange - create a new cart
            Cart target = new Cart();

            // Act
            target.AddItem(p1, 1);
            target.AddItem(p2, 1);

            CartLine[] results = target.Lines.ToArray();

            // Assert
            Assert.Equal(2, results.Length);
            Assert.Equal(p1, results[0].Product);
            Assert.Equal(p2, results[1].Product);
        }
    }
}
