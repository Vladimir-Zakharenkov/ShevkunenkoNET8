Entity Framework Core can generate the schema for the database using the data model classes 
through a feature called migrations. When you prepare a migration, Entity Framework Core 
creates a C# class that contains the SQL commands required to prepare the database. 
If you need to modify your model classes, then you can create a new migration that 
contains the SQL commands required to reflect the changes. In this way, you don’t have 
to worry about manually writing and testing SQL commands and can just focus on the
C# model classes in the application.

Entity Framework Core commands are performed from the command line. Open a PowerShell
command prompt and run the command shown in Listing 7.21 in the SportsStore folder 
to create the migration class that will prepare the database for its first use.

Listing 7.21. Creating the Database Migration

dotnet ef migrations add Initial

When this command has finished, the SportsStore project will contain a Migrations folder. 
This is where Entity Framework Core stores its migration classes. One of the file names 
will be a timestamp followed by _Initial.cs, and this is the class that will be used 
to create the initial schema for the database. If you examine the contents of this file, 
you can see how the Product model class has been used to create the schema.
