The Price property has been decorated with the Column attribute to specify 
the SQL data type that will be used to store values for this property. 
Not all C# types map neatly onto SQL types, and this attribute
ensures the database uses an appropriate type for the application data.

7.1.9		Checking and Running the Application

Before going any further, it is a good idea to make sure the application builds 
and runs as expected. Run the command shown in Listing 7.12 in the SportsStore folder.

Listing 7.12 Running the Example Application

dotnet run

Request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the response shown in Figure 7.2

7.2	Adding Data to the Application

Now that the SportsStore contains some basic setup and can produce a simple response, 
it is time to add some data so that the application has something more useful to display. 
The SportsStore application will store its data in a SQL Server LocalDB database, 
which is accessed using Entity Framework Core. Entity Framework Core is the Microsoft 
object-to-relational mapping (ORM) framework, and it is the most widely
used method of accessing databases in ASP.NET Core projects.

Caution
If you did not install LocalDB when you prepared your development environment 
in Chapter 2, you must do so now. The SportsStore application will not work without 
its database.
