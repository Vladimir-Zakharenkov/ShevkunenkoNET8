Displaying the Page Links

I have everything in place to add the page links to the Index view. I created the view model 
that contains the paging information, updated the controller so that it passes this information 
to the view, and changed the @model directive to match the new model view type. All that remains 
is to add an HTML element that the tag helper will process to create the page links, 
as shown in Listing 7.33

Listing 7.33 Adding the Pagination Links in the Index.cshtml File in the SportsStore/Views/Home Folder

@model ProductsListViewModel

@foreach (var p in Model.Products ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>())
{
    <div>
        <h3>@p.Name</h3>
        @p.Description
        <h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
    </div>
}

<div page-model="@Model.PagingInfo" page-action="Index"></div>

Restart ASP.NET Core and request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the new page links,
as shown in Figure 7-5. The style is still basic, which I will fix later in the chapter. 
What is important for the moment is that the links take the user from page to page 
in the catalog and allow for exploration of the products for sale. When Razor finds 
the page-model attribute on the div element, it asks the PageLinkTagHelper class 
to transform the element, which produces the set of links shown in the figure.
