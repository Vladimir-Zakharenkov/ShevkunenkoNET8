CHAPTER 7

SportsStore: A Real Application

This chapter covers

¡ Creating the SportsStore ASP.NET Core project
¡ Adding a data model and support for a
database
¡ Displaying a basic product catalog
¡ Paginating data
¡ Styling content

In the previous chapters, I built quick and simple ASP.NET Core applications. I described ASP.NET Core
patterns, the essential C# features, and the tools that good ASP.NET Core developers require. Now it is time
to put everything together and build a simple but realistic e-commerce application.

My application, called SportsStore, will follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.
I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart
where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details.
I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for
managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.

My goal in this chapter and those that follow is to give you a sense of what real ASP.NET Core
development is by creating as realistic an example as possible. I want to focus on ASP.NET Core, of course,
so I have simplified the integration with external systems, such as the database, and omitted others entirely,
such as payment processing.
