7.5     Styling the Content

I have built a great deal of infrastructure, and the basic features of the application 
are starting to come together, but I have not paid any attention to appearance. Even though 
this book is not about design or CSS, the SportsStore application design is so miserably plain 
that it undermines its technical strengths. In this section, I will put some of that right. 
I am going to implement a classic two-column layout with a header, as shown in Figure 7.7

7.5.1   Installing the Bootstrap Package

I am going to use the Bootstrap package to provide the CSS styles I will apply to the 
application. As explained in Chapter 4, client-side packages are installed using LibMan. 
If you did not install the LibMan package when following the examples in Chapter 4, 
use a PowerShell command prompt to run the commands shown in Listing 7.35, 
which remove any existing LibMan package and install the version required for this book.

Listing 7.35 Installing the LibMan tool package

dotnet tool uninstall --global Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli --version 2.1.175

Once you have installed LibMan, run the commands shown in Listing 7-36 in 
the SportsStore folder to initialize the example project and install the Bootstrap package.

Listing 7.36    Initializing the Example Project

libman init -p cdnjs
libman install bootstrap@5.2.3 -d wwwroot/lib/bootstrap
