7.2.1		Installing the Entity Framework Core Packages

The first step is to add Entity Framework Core to the project. Use a PowerShell 
command prompt to run the command shown in Listing 7-13 in the SportsStore folder. 
If you receive an error asking you to specify a project, then delete 
the SportsStore - Backup.csproj file in the SportsStore folder and try again.

Listing 7.13	Adding the Entity Framework Core Packages to the SportsStore Project

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 8.0.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --version 8.0.0

These packages install Entity Framework Core and the support for using SQL Server. 
Entity Framework Core also requires a tools package, which includes the command-line 
tools required to prepare and create databases for ASP.NET Core applications. 
Run the commands shown in Listing 7.14 to remove any existing version of the tools 
package, if there is one, and install the version used in this book. (Since this 
package is installed globally, you can run these commands in any folder.)

Listing 7.14 Installing the Entity Framework Core Tool Package

dotnet tool uninstall --global dotnet-ef
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0

7.2.2		Defining the Connection String

Configuration settings, such as database connection strings, are stored in 
JSON configuration files. To describe the connection to the database that 
will be used for the SportsStore data, add the entries shown in
Listing 7.15 to the appsettings.json file in the SportsStore folder.

The project also contains an appsettings.Development.json file that contains 
configuration settings that are used only in development. This file is displayed 
as nested within the appsettings.json file by Solution Explorer but is always visible 
in Visual Studio Code. I use only the appsettings.json file for the development 
of the SportsStore project, but I explain the relationship between the files and how 
they are both used in detail in Chapter 15.

Tip
Connection strings must be expressed as a single unbroken line, which is fine in the code 
editor but doesn’t fit on the printed page and is the cause of the awkward formatting 
in Listing 7.15 When you define the connection string in your own project, make sure 
that the value of the SportsStoreConnection item is on a single line.
