The view is currently expecting a sequence of Product objects, so I need to update the Index.cshtml
file, as shown in Listing 7.32, to deal with the new view model type.

Listing 7.32 Updating the Index.cshtml File in the SportsStore/Views/Home Folder

@model ProductsListViewModel

@foreach (var p in Model.Products ?? Enumerable.Empty<Product>())
{
    <div>
        <h3>@p.Name</h3>
        @p.Description
        <h4>@p.Price.ToString("c")</h4>
    </div>
}

I have changed the @model directive to tell Razor that I am now working with a different 
data type. I updated the foreach loop so that the data source is the Products property 
of the model data.
