To match any value of a specific type, use the type and variable name in 
the case statement, like this:

...
case decimal decimalValue:
...

This case statement matches any decimal value and assigns it to a new variable 
called decimalValue. To be more selective, the when keyword can be included, 
like this:

...
case int intValue when intValue > 50:
...

This case statement matches int values and assigns them to a variable called 
intValue, but only when the value is greater than 50. Restart ASP.NET Core and 
request http://localhost:5000, and you will see the following output in 
the browser window:

Using Extension Methods

Extension methods are a convenient way of adding methods to classes that you 
cannot modify directly, typically because they are provided by Microsoft 
or a third-party package. Listing 5-27 shows the definition of the 
ShoppingCart class, which I added to the Models folder in a class file 
called ShoppingCart.cs and which represents a collection of Product objects.
