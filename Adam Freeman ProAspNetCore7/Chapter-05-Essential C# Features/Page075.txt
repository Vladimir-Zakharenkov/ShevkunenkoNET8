CHAPTER 5

Essential C# Features

In this chapter, I describe C# features used in web application development that 
are not widely understood or that often cause confusion. This is not a book about 
C#, however, so I provide only a brief example for each feature so that you can 
follow the examples in the rest of the book and take advantage of these features
in your projects. Table 5-1 summarizes this chapter.

Table 5-1. Chapter Summary

Problem										Solution									Listing

Reducing duplication in using statements	Use global or implicit using statements.	8–10

Managing null values						Use nullable and non-nullable types, 
											which are managed with the null management 
											operators.									11–18

Mixing static and dynamic values in strings	Use string interpolation.					19

Initializing and populate objects			Use the object and collection initializers 
											and target-typed new expressions.			20–24

Assigning a value for specific types		Use pattern matching.						25, 26

Extending the functionality of a class		Define an extension method.					27–34 
without modifying it

Expressing functions and methods concisely	Use lambda expressions.						35–42

Defining a variable without explicitly		Use the var keyword.						43–45 
declaring its type

Modifying an interface without requiring	Define a default implementation.			46–50
changes in its implementation classes

Performing work asynchronously				Use tasks or the async/await keywords.		51–53

Producing a sequence of values over time	Use an asynchronous enumerable.				54–57

Getting the name of a class or member		Use a nameof expression.					58, 59
