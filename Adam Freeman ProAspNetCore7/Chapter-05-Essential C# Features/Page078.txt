5.1.5	Running the Example Application

Start ASP.NET Core by running the command shown in Listing 5-7 in 
the LanguageFeatures folder.

Listing 5-7. Running the Example Application

dotnet run

The output from the dotnet run command will include two build warnings, 
which I explain in the “Understanding Null State Analysis” section. 
Once ASP.NET Core has started, use a web browser to request
http://localhost:5000, and you will see the output shown in Figure 5-1.

Since the output from all the examples in this chapter is text, I will show 
the messages displayed by the browser like this:

5.2	Understanding Top-Level Statements

Top-level statements are intended to remove unnecessary code structure from class files. 
A project can contain one file that defines code statements outside of a namespace 
or a file. For ASP.NET Core applications, this feature is used to configure 
the application in the Program.cs file. As a reminder, here is the content of 
the Program.cs file in the example application for this chapter:

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

//app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.MapDefaultControllerRoute();

app.Run();
