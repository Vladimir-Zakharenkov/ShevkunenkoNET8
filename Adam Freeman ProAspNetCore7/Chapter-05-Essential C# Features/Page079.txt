Running the Example Application

Start ASP.NET Core by running the command shown in Listing 5-7 in 
the LanguageFeatures folder.

Listing 5-7. Running the Example Application

dotnet run

The output from the dotnet run command will include two build warnings, 
which I explain in the “Understanding Null State Analysis” section. 
Once ASP.NET Core has started, use a web browser to request
http://localhost:5000, and you will see the output shown in Figure 5-1.
