This resolves one warning and introduces another, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3. An additional null state analysis warning
(https://sergeyshef.ru/img/freeman-asp-net-core-6/Figure-5-3.png)

The statement flagged by the compiler attempts to access the Name field 
of the element at index zero in the array, which might be null since 
the array type is Product?[]. Addressing this issue requires a check for
null values, as shown in Listing 5-14.

Listing 5-14. Guarding Against a null Value in the HomeController.cs File in the Controllers Folder

namespace LanguageFeatures.Controllers {
	public class HomeController : Controller {

		public ViewResult Index() {
			Product?[] products = Product.GetProducts();
			Product? p = products[0];
			string val;
			if (p != null) {
				val = p.Name;
			} else {
				val = "No value";
			}
			return View(new string[] { val });
		}
	}
