CHAPTER 5

Essential C# Features

This chapter covers

•	Using C# language features for ASP.NET Core development
•	 Dealing with null values and the null state analysis feature
•	Creating objects concisely
•	Adding features to classes without directly modifying them
•	Expressing functions concisely
•	Modifying interfaces without breaking implementation classes
•	Defining asynchronous methods

In this chapter, I describe C# features used in web application development that 
are not widely understood or that often cause confusion. This is not a book about 
C#, however, so I provide only a brief example for each feature so that you can 
follow the examples in the rest of the book and take advantage of these features
in your projects. Table 5-1 summarizes this chapter.
