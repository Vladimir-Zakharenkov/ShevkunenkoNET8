5.4 Understanding Null State Analysis

The editor and compiler warnings shown in earlier sections are produced because 
ASP.NET Core project templates enable null state analysis, in which the compiler 
identifies attempts to access references that may be unintentionally null, 
preventing null reference exceptions at runtime.

Open the Product.cs file, and the editor will display two warnings, 
as shown in Figure 5-2. The figure shows how Visual Studio displays a warning, 
but Visual Studio Code is similar.

When null state analysis is enabled, C# variables are divided into two groups: 
nullable and nonnullable. As their name suggests, nullable variables can be null. 
This is the behavior that most programmers are familiar with, and it is entirely up 
to the developer to guard against trying to use null references, which will trigger 
a NullReferenceException.
