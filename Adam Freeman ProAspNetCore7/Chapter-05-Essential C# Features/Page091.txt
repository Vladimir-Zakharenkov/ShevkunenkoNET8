Using String Interpolation

C# supports string interpolation to create formatted strings, which uses templates 
with variable names that are resolved and inserted into the output, as shown in 
Listing 5-19.

Listing 5-19. Using String Interpolation in the HomeController.cs File 
in the Controllers Folder

namespace LanguageFeatures.Controllers {
	public class HomeController : Controller {
		public ViewResult Index() {
		Product?[] products = Product.GetProducts();
		return View(new string[] {
			$"Name: {products[0]?.Name}, Price: { products[0]?.Price }"
			});
		}
	}
}

Interpolated strings are prefixed with the $ character and contain holes, which are 
references to values contained within the { and } characters. When the string is 
evaluated, the holes are filled in with the current values of the variables or 
constants that are specified.

Tip
String interpolation supports the string format specifiers, which can be applied 
within holes, so $"Price: {price:C2}" would format the price value as a currency 
value with two decimal digits, for example.

Start ASP.NET Core and request http://localhost:5000, and you will see a formatted 
string:

Name: Kayak, Price: 275

Using Object and Collection Initializers

When I create an object in the static GetProducts method of the Product class, 
I use an object initializer, which allows me to create an object and specify 
its property values in a single step, like this:

...
Product kayak = new Product {
Name = "Kayak", Price = 275M
};
...
